# TiDB Decision Tree

AI-powered decision tree visualization with TiDB Serverless Branching.

Fork it, add your API key, deploy.

## What it does

Describe your situation. Get 2-3 branching paths with 5, 10, and 20 year outcomes. Explore them in a visual tree. Hit a save point, branch off, try a different choice. Share the URL with friends.

## How TiDB branching fits in

Each life simulation is a database branch. Explore Path A, save, branch to Path B. Go back to any decision point and try something else.

All paths get stored with vector embeddings. You can actually search "show me paths where I ended up in tech" and it works.

Same `(user_id, branch)` pattern from atlasMemory. This proves the branching concept in a real consumer product, not just a demo.

## Tech stack
